It's the only Pokémon that can charge your phone in the wild, make your hair stand on end with just a glance, and still look adorable in a detective's hat. Other Pokémon might have more strength or better stats, but do they come with that charming smile and an ability to provide emergency jump-starts to your car? I think not. In the world of Pokémon, Pikachu is the real MVP - Most Voltaic Pokémon!",
