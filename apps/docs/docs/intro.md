# RecipeUI

RecipeUI is redefining how we think about API docs and playgrounds. We've all been there before, trying out some new API and ripping our hair out just to get a simple example running. 

A recipe is essentially an API setup that's good to go. Someone put in a lot of effort to share with your their recipe for how they got the API working. Using our platform, you can run any recipe in minutes.

## Getting Started

Visit our website at www.recipeui.com and start playing around!

## Authentication

Authentication is always going to be a pain and it differs for every API. We tackle this problem head on by writing auth docs for every guide.
